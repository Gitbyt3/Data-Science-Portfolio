## Project 1: Publication Click-Rate Analysis for a Think Tank
**Objective:** Investigate trends in the clicks and identify their causes
- Data was sourced from two databases, one containing click data and the other containing publication characteristics
- Extensive data wrangling was conducted as the raw click data was near unusable in its original state
- The analysis uncovered multiple variables potentially responsible for the downloads/views. These were:\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Frequency of publication releases\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Publication type\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Publication topic
- (**WIP**) Using the Google Trends API to investigate if publication keyword popularity impacts the downloads/views
- Below is an example of an exploratory visualisation from the project generated using Seaborn. Languages are not detailed for privacy reasons
