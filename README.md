## Project 1: Publication Click-Rate Analysis for a Think Tank
**Objective:** Understand the state of the Think Tank's publication library, confirm their aggregate downloads/views were decreasing, and find out why
- Data was taken from an internal dashboard tracking individual publication performance and a database of all publication characteristics
- Extensive data wrangling was conducted as the raw internal dashboard was near unusable in its original state
- The analysis uncovered multiple variables potentially responsible for the downloads/views. These were:\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Frequency of publication releases\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Publication type\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Publication topic
- (**WIP**) Using the Google Trends API to investigate if publication keyword popularity impacts the downloads/views
- Below are some sample exploratory visualisations generated using the Seaborn package
