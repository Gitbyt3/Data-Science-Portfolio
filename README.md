## Project 1: [Publication Click-Rate Analysis for a Think Tank](https://github.com/Gitbyt3/Click-Rate-Analysis)
**Objective:** Investigate trends in publication downloads & views and identify their causes
- Data was sourced from two internal databases, one containing click data and the other containing publication characteristics
- Extensive data wrangling was conducted as the raw click data was near unusable in its original state
- The regression analysis uncovered multiple variables potentially responsible for the downloads/views. These were:\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Frequency of publication releases\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Publication type\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Publication topic
- Below is an example of an exploratory visualisation from the project generated using the Seaborn data visualisation library

## Project 2: [Publication Dashboard Automation for a Think Tank](https://github.com/Gitbyt3/Publication-Dashboard-Automation)
**Objective:** Automate monthly data entry for publication performance
- Data was compiled from monthly Excel files containing publication downloads & views, Google Analytics, and publication title webscraping
- Webscraping was needed to pull the released publications from the Think Tank's website and Neliti, a research paper repository, and compare the titles with the current titles on the dashboard
- The code is run every month to add the previous month's data to the Google Sheets dashboard
- The Google Sheets, Google Drive, and Google Analytics APIs were setup using Google Cloud

## Project 3: [State of ESG in Indonesia Research Project](https://github.com/Gitbyt3/ESG-Research-Project)
**Objective:** Understand the current state of Indonesian sustainability research projects and identify relationships between ESG rating and financial performance
- Data was mainly gathered from Yahoo Finance and Newswhip
- Bulk of the analysis concentrated on news article headline analysis and the associated keywords generated from Newswhip
- First part of the project uncovered that ESG and CSR media interest was roughly equivalent from 2021 to 2023
- Second part of the project centered on what sorts of company sustainability projects Indonesian media reported on
- The scope of the project was not large enough to conduct an in depth analysis of the ESG rating's impact on financial performance
